# Iowa-State-College-Basketball-Analysis

**Overview**
This project is an exploratory sales data analysis using Python and Tableau for visualizations. Based on Andrew Sundberg's extensive college basketball dataset, I tasked myself with an introductory analysis of the data provided. I focused my sights on Iowa State's performance and an evaluation of its performance metrics. At the beginning of my exploratory analysis, I performed basic queries to use as a reference point for later queries. 

**General Data**
- Find average wins for the entire league by year
- Calculate average wins for each team
- Calculate correlation between adjusted offense and defense to winning

**Champions Data**
- Find and sort all NCAA champions from 2013 - 2023

**Iowa State Analysis**
- Locate Iowa State's performance for each year
  - Visualized teams wins over the decade
- Find correlation between selected Iowa State metrics and wins
  - Visualized F-score
- Predict Iowa State wins for the 2023 - 2024 season with highly correlated variables

**Programs Used**
* Python Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau
